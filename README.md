Registration Management System
This project is a Full Stack Web Application developed as part of my internship as a Full Stack Developer Intern.
The application is designed to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and demonstrates the integration of front-end, back-end, and database technologies.
The project provides a user-friendly interface where users can enter data, view records, and manage information efficiently. The backend handles data processing and communicates with the database to store and retrieve information securely.
